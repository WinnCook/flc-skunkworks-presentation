---

## 0. CURRENT PHASE

**READY** - Presentation polished and ready for VP presentation Thursday

---

## 1. SNAPSHOT

- **Session 9 Deployment & Fix:**
  - Deployed presentation to GitHub Pages: https://winncook.github.io/flc-skunkworks-presentation/
  - Created public repo `WinnCook/flc-skunkworks-presentation` for sharing
  - Fixed Command Center dashboard math: added missing Productivity Savings card ($4K)
  - All 5 metrics now display: Total ($24K) = Cost Savings ($12K) + Revenue ($8K) + Productivity ($4K)
  - Updated PDF export to show all 5 metrics
- **Session 8 Addition:**
  - Created new "Origin Story" page (`origin-story.html`) explaining Skunk Works history
  - Page covers: The 1943 problem, Kelly Johnson, the 6 rules, what they built (P-80, U-2, SR-71, F-117), why it worked, FLC mapping, executive framing
  - Added amber/orange "Origin Story" navigation button to index.html (right of Command Center)
  - Includes back-to-presentation link, matching dark theme, AOS animations, SR-71 silhouette
  - Removed decorative quote marks per user preference (kept title quotes only)
- **Session 7 Refinements:**
  - Moved "Winn Cook" from heading to first bullet (matches Mario Martinez treatment)
  - Updated local AI bullet: "software development workflows for building institutional applications"
  - Added FERPA/PII compliance to Measured Risk principle card
  - Removed "Workday Analytics" from Future Pipeline (now 3-column grid)
  - Rebranded "Data Security Leadership" → "Locally Trained AI" (fine-tuning, FERPA, strategic independence)
  - Softened "The Fit" language (removed "rare combination")
  - Generated full PDF export of presentation
- **Key messaging now emphasizes:**
  - Low risk, clear decision points, built-in off-ramps
  - Per-project stipends (~$5K* each, negotiable)
  - Summer 2026 decision framework
  - FERPA compliance and data protection throughout
  - Foundation/auxiliary entity as aspirational outcome
- AI Conference is TOMORROW (12/16)
- VP presentation Thursday 12/18

---

## 2. ACTIVE TASK

**Final prep for VP presentation Thursday**
- Review presentation flow in browser
- Practice the pitch narrative
- Be ready to discuss stipend amounts
- Gather any additional insights from AI Conference tomorrow

---

## 3. THE NEW PITCH STRUCTURE

### Triple Emotional Sell
1. **EXCITEMENT + FOMO** - "AI is transforming higher ed NOW, don't fall behind"
2. **CONFIDENCE + LOW RISK** - "Measured experiment with decision points and off-ramps"
3. **IMPRESSED + TRUSTING** - "Winn has the credentials, this presentation is proof"

### The Ask (Specific)
- Per-project stipends of ~$5K* during Phase 1 (Jan-June 2025)
- 3 Phase 1 projects: Conference App, AI Transcription, Software Replication
- Formal designation of AI Exploration Initiative
- Quarterly review meetings

### Summer Decision Framework
- **Sparse results** → Back to normal IR (no harm done)
- **Moderate results** → Hybrid arrangement (IR + AI projects)
- **High value** → Full-time AI role, Foundation entity path

### Objection Handling Built In
- **Job displacement** → "AI augments humans, doesn't replace"
- **Budget constraints** → "Max exposure $15K, no FTE costs"
- **Data security** → "Local AI models, FERPA compliant"
