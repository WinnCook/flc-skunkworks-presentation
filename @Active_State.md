---

## 2. ACTIVE TASK

**Final prep for VP presentation Thursday**
- Review presentation flow in browser
- Practice the pitch narrative
- Be ready to discuss BOTH options: Stipend OR Partnership Path (Altitude AI)
- Partnership Path offers lower friction for FLC (vendor budget vs. HR/compensation)
- Gather any additional insights from AI Conference (12/16)

---

## 3. THE NEW PITCH STRUCTURE

### Triple Emotional Sell
1. **EXCITEMENT + FOMO** - "AI is transforming higher ed NOW, don't fall behind"
2. **CONFIDENCE + LOW RISK** - "Measured experiment with decision points and off-ramps"
3. **IMPRESSED + TRUSTING** - "Winn has the credentials, this presentation is proof"

### The Ask (Two Options)

**Option A: Stipend Model**
- Per-project costs of **$7,500** during Phase 1 (Jan-August 2026)
- Processed through HR/compensation

**Option B: Partnership Path (Altitude AI)** ← *Lower friction*
- Vendor invoicing through Altitude AI (Colorado LLC)
- Uses existing procurement budget (no HR involvement)
- FLC benefits: No asset tracking, no benefits burden, project-based accountability
- Equipment/subscriptions owned by entity (no sunk costs for FLC)

**Total Phase 1 Investment:** $22,500 (3 projects × $7,500)

**Both Options Include:**
- 3 Phase 1 projects: Conference App, AI Transcription, Enrollment Forecasting v2
- Formal designation of AI Exploration Initiative
- Quarterly review meetings

### Summer Decision Framework
- **Sparse results** → Back to normal IR (no harm done)
- **Moderate results** → Hybrid arrangement (IR + AI projects)
- **High value** → Full-time AI role, Foundation entity path

### Objection Handling Built In
- **Job displacement** → "AI augments humans, doesn't replace"
- **Budget constraints** → "Max exposure $22.5K, no FTE costs, 5-year ROI of 618%"
- **Data security** → "Local AI models, FERPA compliant"
