## 2. ACTIVE TASK

**Final prep for VP presentation Thursday**
- Review presentation flow in browser
- Practice the pitch narrative
- Be ready to discuss stipend amounts
- Gather any additional insights from AI Conference tomorrow

---

## 3. THE NEW PITCH STRUCTURE

### Triple Emotional Sell
1. **EXCITEMENT + FOMO** - "AI is transforming higher ed NOW, don't fall behind"
2. **CONFIDENCE + LOW RISK** - "Measured experiment with decision points and off-ramps"
3. **IMPRESSED + TRUSTING** - "Winn has the credentials, this presentation is proof"

### The Ask (Specific)
- Per-project stipends of ~$5K* during Phase 1 (Jan-June 2025)
- 3 Phase 1 projects: Conference App, AI Transcription, Software Replication
- Formal designation of AI Exploration Initiative
- Quarterly review meetings

### Summer Decision Framework
- **Sparse results** → Back to normal IR (no harm done)
- **Moderate results** → Hybrid arrangement (IR + AI projects)
- **High value** → Full-time AI role, Foundation entity path

### Objection Handling Built In
- **Job displacement** → "AI augments humans, doesn't replace"
- **Budget constraints** → "Max exposure $15K, no FTE costs"
- **Data security** → "Local AI models, FERPA compliant"
