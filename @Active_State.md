## 7. SESSION CONTINUITY

### For Next Session
**Start Here:** Continue building the HTML showcase in `/initiatives/vp-presentation-121825/artifacts/html-showcase/`

**Context Needed:**
1. Read @Program_Charter.md for program context
2. Check initiative manifests for content to include
3. Review @Value_Ledger.md for ROI figures

**Handoff Notes:**
- HTML showcase is the priority - everything else can wait until after Thursday
- WOW factor is paramount - this is a pitch for a stipend/bonus
- Dark mode option would be impressive
