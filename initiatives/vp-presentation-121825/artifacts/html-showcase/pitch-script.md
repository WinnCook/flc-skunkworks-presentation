# VP Pitch Script - December 18, 2025

## Your Numbers (Memorize These)
- **Investment:** $22,500 (3 projects × $7,500)
- **Payment:** 50/50 — $3,750 on approval, $3,750 on delivery
- **Timeline:** Jan - August 2026
- **Year 1 Value:** $9,300+ (conservative hard numbers)
- **Year 2+ Value:** $15,000+ with adoption
- **IP:** All deliverables owned by FLC

---

## Opening (2 min)
> "Thank you for this opportunity. I'm asking for $22,500 to fund three AI innovation projects over the next eight months. Payment is 50/50 — half on approval, half when I deliver. FLC owns everything I build. Monthly progress reports. Zero permanent commitments."

**Hit:**
- Direct ask upfront - don't bury the lede
- 50/50 payment = FLC holds leverage until results delivered
- IP ownership upfront = FLC keeps everything regardless of outcome
- Monthly reporting = full transparency, no surprises

---

### Page 2: Dashboard (dashboard.html)
**When to show:** If they want to explore numbers or ask "how did you calculate that?"

**Key points:**
- Toggle between Conservative / Moderate / Optimistic scenarios
- Click any initiative card to expand and see value breakdown
- 5-Year Financial Projection table shows compound returns
- "These numbers are editable — you can model your own scenarios"

**Don't linger:** Dashboard is backup detail, not the main pitch.

---

### Page 3: Partnership Path (partnership-path.html)
**When to show:** When discussing the structure (stipend vs vendor)

**Key points:**
- Two paths: Stipend Model vs. Partnership Path (Altitude AI)
- 6 benefit boxes: Project accountability, procurement simplicity, no asset overhead, etc.
- "How It Works" — 3 simple steps
- "Founding Partner Advantage" — first-mover benefits

**Key phrase:** "Partnership Path is simpler for FLC — uses existing vendor process, no HR policy questions."

---

### Page 4: Origins (origin-story.html)
**When to show:** Only if asked "What is Skunk Works?" or as brief context

**Key points:**
- Lockheed 1943 story — small team, big results
- Kelly Johnson's 6 rules
- SR-71, F-117, U-2 — proof it works
- FLC mapping — same principles applied here

**Don't overdo it:** 30 seconds max unless they're engaged.

### Page 5: Horizon Concept Demo (external link)
**When to show:** If they ask about web presence or want to see AI capabilities in action

**URL:** https://winncook.github.io/concept-demo-flc-website-prototype/

**Key point:** "This is a concept demo of what an FLC website redesign could look like — built in hours, not months."

## The Three Projects (4 min)

### 1. Event Management App (Whova Replacement)
- **Hard savings:** $4,000/year (eliminate Whova license after 2 years)
- **Institutional asset:** Customizable for events of any scale
- **Community value:** Supports campus and partner engagements

### 2. AI Meeting Assistant (Otter AI Replacement)
- **Attends meetings for you:** Captures transcripts, notes, action items
- **Regulatory compliance:** Comprehensive documentation, executive-level recaps
- **Internal communication:** Auto-drafted functional area updates
- **PD opportunities:** Attend sessions otherwise missed due to scheduling conflicts
- **Savings:** ~$2,500/year (Otter AI replacement)

### 3. Enrollment Forecasting v2
- **Proven foundation:** v1 had <2% error rate
- **Executive web dashboard:** Leadership can model scenarios in real time
- **Finance team access:** Budget implications analysis

**Key phrase:** "These aren't theoretical. I know how to build each one."

---

## The Safety Net (2 min)

**Three outcomes at August 2026 - all acceptable:**
1. **Sparse results** → Back to normal IR. No harm done.
2. **Moderate results** → Hybrid arrangement (IR + AI projects)
3. **High value** → Explore full-time AI role / entity structure

**Key phrase:** "You're not committing to anything permanent. You're buying an option on innovation."

---

## The Ask - Lead with Partnership (1 min)

> "For the structure, I recommend we set this up as a vendor relationship. I'll form a Colorado LLC - Altitude AI - and invoice FLC for each project."

**Why Partnership benefits FLC:**
- No HR policy questions about supplemental pay
- Uses existing procurement process
- Equipment/subscriptions stay with me, not FLC assets
- If you want to stop, just don't issue the next PO

**Fallback:** "If that doesn't work, we can also do per-project stipends through HR."

---

## Objection Responses

**"That's a lot of money"**
> "I understand. And you only pay half upfront — the other half when I deliver. Year 1 conservative value is $9,300 in hard savings alone. Plus FLC owns everything regardless of outcome."

**"What if it doesn't work?"**
> "Then you've spent at most $22,500 and own three working applications. I go back to normal IR. You keep everything I built. But based on v1 forecasting success, I'm confident we'll deliver."

**"Why do you need an LLC?"**
> "It simplifies procurement for you - uses existing vendor processes, no HR policy questions, cleaner accounting. For me it's more paperwork, but for FLC it's actually simpler."

**"What about conflict of interest?"**
> "I've reviewed the guidelines and I'm prepared to file full disclosure with HR. All work stays FLC's intellectual property."

**"What about IP ownership?"**
> "FLC owns everything — code, documentation, all deliverables. That's built into the terms. If I leave tomorrow, you keep it all."

**"Why can't this be done in your normal role?"**
> "These projects require dedicated focus time outside normal IR responsibilities. The contract compensates for evenings/weekends and signals institutional commitment to innovation."

**"How do we know you'll deliver?"**
> "50/50 payment. You hold half the money until I deliver. Monthly progress reports so you see exactly where things stand. No surprises."

## The Close

> "I believe this is a low-risk, high-reward opportunity for FLC. I'm asking for your support to make it happen. What questions do you have?"

**Then STOP TALKING.** Let them respond.

---

## Delivery Tips

- **Speak slowly.** Nervous energy reads as insecurity.
- **Make eye contact.** You're a peer presenting a business case.
- **Use pauses.** After key points, let them land.
- **Don't fill silence.** After asking for questions, wait.
- **Don't negotiate against yourself.** $22.5K isn't a lot for what you're offering.

---

## If Approved

1. Send thank-you email within 2 hours
2. File LLC within 1 week
3. Submit W-9 to FLC AP
4. Send first project scope within 2 weeks
5. **Schedule Q1 2026 review meeting before leaving the room**

---

## Mindset

- This is a business negotiation, not a performance review
- You're offering value, not asking for a favor
- Worst case: they say no, nothing changes
- Best case: you launch a company with an anchor client

**You've got this.**
