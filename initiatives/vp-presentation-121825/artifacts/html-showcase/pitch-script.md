# VP Pitch Script - December 18, 2025

## Your Numbers (Memorize These)
- **Investment:** $22,500 (3 projects × $7,500)
- **Timeline:** Jan - August 2026
- **Annual Value:** $15,000+ (conservative)
- **5-Year ROI:** Auto-calculated in dashboard

---

## Opening (2 min)
> "Thank you for this opportunity. I'm asking for $22,500 to fund three AI innovation projects over the next eight months. This is a measured experiment with clear decision points and zero permanent commitments."

**Hit:**
- Direct ask upfront - don't bury the lede
- Frame as "measured experiment" not "risky bet"
- Zero permanent commitments = low risk

---

## The Three Projects (4 min)

### 1. Conference App (Whova Replacement)
- **Hard savings:** $4,000/year (eliminate Whova license)
- **Built for FLC:** Custom features, no vendor lock-in
- **Ready to build:** I know exactly how to do this

### 2. AI Transcription (Otter AI Replacement)
- **Campus-wide productivity:** Meeting transcription for everyone
- **FERPA compliant:** Data stays local, not in vendor cloud
- **Cost avoidance:** ~$2,500/year in subscriptions

### 3. Enrollment Forecasting v2
- **Proven foundation:** v1 had <2% error rate
- **Strategic planning:** What-if scenarios for enrollment
- **Competitive advantage:** Tools that inform decisions

**Key phrase:** "These aren't theoretical. I know how to build each one."

---

## The Safety Net (2 min)

**Three outcomes at August 2026 - all acceptable:**
1. **Sparse results** → Back to normal IR. No harm done.
2. **Moderate results** → Hybrid arrangement (IR + AI projects)
3. **High value** → Explore full-time AI role / entity structure

**Key phrase:** "You're not committing to anything permanent. You're buying an option on innovation."

---

## The Ask - Lead with Partnership (1 min)

> "For the structure, I recommend we set this up as a vendor relationship. I'll form a Colorado LLC - Altitude AI - and invoice FLC for each project."

**Why Partnership benefits FLC:**
- No HR policy questions about supplemental pay
- Uses existing procurement process
- Equipment/subscriptions stay with me, not FLC assets
- If you want to stop, just don't issue the next PO

**Fallback:** "If that doesn't work, we can also do per-project stipends through HR."

---

## Objection Responses

**"That's a lot of money"**
> "I understand. The investment pays for itself in year one with hard savings alone - $4K Whova + $2.5K transcription = $6.5K. Everything else is upside."

**"What if it doesn't work?"**
> "Then we've learned something valuable and I go back to normal IR. No harm done. But based on v1 forecasting success, I'm confident we'll deliver."

**"Why do you need an LLC?"**
> "It simplifies procurement for you - uses existing vendor processes, no HR policy questions, cleaner accounting. For me it's more paperwork, but for FLC it's actually simpler."

**"What about conflict of interest?"**
> "I've reviewed the guidelines and I'm prepared to file full disclosure with HR. All work stays FLC's intellectual property."

**"Why can't this be done in your normal role?"**
> "These projects require dedicated focus time outside normal IR responsibilities. The contract compensates for evenings/weekends and signals institutional commitment to innovation."

## The Close

> "I believe this is a low-risk, high-reward opportunity for FLC. I'm asking for your support to make it happen. What questions do you have?"

**Then STOP TALKING.** Let them respond.

---

## Delivery Tips

- **Speak slowly.** Nervous energy reads as insecurity.
- **Make eye contact.** You're a peer presenting a business case.
- **Use pauses.** After key points, let them land.
- **Don't fill silence.** After asking for questions, wait.
- **Don't negotiate against yourself.** $22.5K isn't a lot for what you're offering.

---

## If Approved

1. Send thank-you email within 2 hours
2. File LLC within 1 week
3. Submit W-9 to FLC AP
4. Send first project scope within 2 weeks
5. **Schedule Q1 2026 review meeting before leaving the room**

---

## Mindset

- This is a business negotiation, not a performance review
- You're offering value, not asking for a favor
- Worst case: they say no, nothing changes
- Best case: you launch a company with an anchor client

**You've got this.**
