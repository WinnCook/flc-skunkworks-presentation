# Initiative Manifest: VP Presentation - December 18, 2025
**Slug:** vp-presentation-121825
**Created:** 2025-12-15
**Owner:** [Your Name], Institutional Researcher
**Sponsor/Requestor:** Self-initiated (career development)

## 1. INITIATIVE SUMMARY

**One-Liner:** Deliver a WOW-factor interactive HTML presentation to VP showcasing the Skunk Works program and securing a stipend/bonus.

**Problem Statement:**
The value being delivered through innovative IR work is not fully visible or recognized. A formal presentation is needed to:
- Establish the Skunk Works program officially
- Demonstrate the potential ROI of initiatives
- Secure immediate financial recognition (stipend/bonus)
- Build the case for expanded role and compensation

**Proposed Solution:**
Create an interactive HTML "command center" that serves as both a presentation and a demonstration of AI/tech capabilities. The presentation itself IS the proof of concept.
